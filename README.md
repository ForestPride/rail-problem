Solve the problem  of if people should stand or walk on subway escalators.

User story

Bob wants to know if people should stand only or stand and walk on the escalators
and the best time interval for the trains to arrive at the station.

Bob wants a flexible program that can be used by many different train stations.

Bob can tell the software:

1) how many escalators there are,
2) how many people can fit in the station,
3) the rate people enter/leave the train cars (leave and enter rates are equal),
4) how many people can fit on a train car,
5) the transit time on an escalator if everyone stands,
6) the transit time on an escalator if some people stand and some people walk,
7) the number of people per tread on an escalator,
8) the distance between people on an escalator,
8) the number of train cars.

Bob enters what he knows into the program and the program decides if it's better
to stand or walk and the best time interval for the trains.
