Solve the problem  of if people should stand or walk on subway escalators.

User story

Bob wants to know if people should stand only or stand and walk on the escalators.

Bob wants a flexible program that can be used by many different train stations.

Bob can tell the software:

1) how many escalators there are,
2) how many people can fit in the station,
3) the rate people enter/leave the train cars (leave and enter rates are equal),
4) how many people can fit on a train car,
5) the rate of people leaving an escalator if everyone stands,
6) the rate of people leaving the escalator if some people stand and some people walk,
7) the maximum of train cars

Bob enters what he knows into the program and the program decides if it's better
to stand or walk.
